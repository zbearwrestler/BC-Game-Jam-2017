For working in Unity it has been suggested for everyone to use their own scenes for testing.
For the final build it will all be put in one scene with prefabs that we can collaborate on.
This makes merging easier and will save alot of headaches.  
Add folders as needed and try to keep assets organized as needed.  
Feel free to ask for any clarifications I wrote the todo list kinda late so let me know if its off
